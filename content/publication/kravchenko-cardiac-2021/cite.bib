 abstract = {Background
Myocardial injury and inflammation on cardiac MRI in patients suffering
from coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have been described in recent
publications. Concurrently, a chronic COVID-19 syndrome (CCS) after
COVID-19 infection has been observed manifesting with symptoms like
fatigue and exertional dyspnea.

Purpose
To explore the relationship between CCS and myocardial injury and
inflammation as an underlying cause of the persistent complaints in
previously healthy individuals.

Materials and Methods
In this prospective study from January 2021 to April 2021, study
participants without known cardiac or pulmonary diseases prior to
COVID-19 infection with persisting CCS symptoms like fatigue or
exertional dyspnea after convalescence and healthy control participants
underwent cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI protocol included T1 and T2
relaxation times, extracellular volume (ECV), T2 signal intensity ratio,
and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Student t test,
Mann-Whitney U test, and χ2 test were used for
statistical analysis.

Results
41 participants with CCS (39±13 years; 18 men) and 42 control
participants (39±16 years; 26 men) were evaluated. Median time
between initial mild to moderate COVID-19 disease without
hospitalization and cardiac MRI was 103 days (interquartile range:
88-158). Troponin T levels were normal. Parameters indicating myocardial
inflammation and edema were comparable between participants with CCS and
control participants: T1 relaxation time (978±23 ms vs
971±25 ms; P=.17), T2 relaxation time (53±2 ms vs
52±2 ms; P=.47), T2 signal intensity ratio (1.6±0.2 vs
1.6±0.3; P=.10). Visible myocardial edema was present in none of
the participants. Three of 41 (7%) participants with CCS demonstrated
non-ischemic LGE compared to none in the control group (0 of 42 [0%];
P=.07). None of the participants fulfilled the 2018 Lake Louise criteria
for the diagnosis of myocarditis.

Conclusion
Individuals without hospitalization for COVID-19 and with CCS did not
demonstrate signs of active myocardial injury or inflammation on cardiac
MRI., See also the editorial by Lima and Bluemke.},
