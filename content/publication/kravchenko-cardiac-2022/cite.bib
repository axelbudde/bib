 abstract = {The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an equally expediently deployed vaccination campaign with more than 12Â billion vaccinations administered worldwide. Reports of vaccine-associated adverse reactions (VAARs) have ranged from headaches and pain at the injection site to potentially life-threatening events such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The heart has also not been spared of VAARs, as vaccine-associated myocardial infarction and more commonly, albeit still rare, myocarditis and perimyocarditis have been reported in predominantly young male recipients.},
