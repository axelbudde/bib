 abstract = {Within the elderly population, psychogeriatric patients may be particularly susceptible to negative mental health effects of the coronavirus crisis. Detailed information about the psychosocial well-being of psychogeriatric patients during the pandemic is still sparse. Here we examined which aspects of subjective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic especially affect levels of depression, anxiety and quality of life in psychogeriatric patients with and without cognitive impairment. A cross-sectional paper survey was conducted during the first German lockdown among patients with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder (≥ 60 years) or a diagnosed neurodegenerative disease (regardless of their age) from the department for neurodegenerative diseases and geriatric psychiatry at the University of Bonn. The WHO-5-, GAD-7- and WHOQOL-old score were used to determine levels of depression, anxiety and quality of life. The second part obtained information about the subjective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistical analysis included among others principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. COVID-19-related, immediate distress was a strong predictor of elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety and a reduced quality of life. COVID-19-related concerns regarding health and financial security, however, were not significantly associated with negative mental health outcomes. The overall prevalence of symptoms of depression (50.8% [95% CI 43.8–57.6%]) and anxiety (32.7% [95% CI 26.4–39.2%]) among psychogeriatric patients was high. Our findings indicate that psychogeriatric patients are not significantly affected by COVID-19-related concerns but are primarily suffering from emotional consequences resulting from changed living conditions due to the pandemic.},
