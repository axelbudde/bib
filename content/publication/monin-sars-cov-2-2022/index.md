abstract: "Bollipo et al 1 presented recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLDs). Since their publication, at least three SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations are recommended for all persons regardless of comorbidities.2 Cancer and CLD are associated with impaired immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.3–6 However, patients with GI cancer, especially with hepatobilary carcinoma (HBC), are under-represented in published studies.  In this prospective, longitudinal study, 120 patients with GI cancer, including 32.5% HBC, participated (table 1). Patients under anticancer therapy were analysed compared with patients with GI cancer in follow-up care (≥1 year off anticancer therapy). We present profound data on humoral response rates (SARS-CoV-2 antispike and surrogate neutralisation antibodies (sNAB) using SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories) and cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (GenScript), respectively). Of note, the ELISA analysing levels of sNAB is limited when it comes to current variants of concern (VOCs; BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5). Therefore, rates of infections are more important. Cellular response rates were not considered. Linear mixed regression models were used to compare levels of total (log10 transformed) and neutralising antibodies.  View this table:  Table 1  Patientbaseline characteristics    Four weeks after second vaccination, levels of SARS-CoV-2 antispike IgG were significantly lower in patients with active GI cancer (2.48 log10 binding antibody unit (BAU)/mL; 95% CI 2.28 to 2.68; ptextless0.01) and HBC (2.52 log10 BAU/mL; 95% CI 2.25 to 2.78; ptextless0.01) compared with patients …"
