 abstract = {(1) Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are currently employed on a population-wide scale in most countries worldwide. Data about unusual cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADR) are scant, though. (2) Methods: We retrospectively analyzed moderate to severe vaccine-related ADR in the Department of Dermatology and Allergy of the University Hospital Bonn between May to June 2021 and analyzed related skin biopsies. (3) Results: As a specialized dermatological academic center, we encountered a total of n = 19 clinically and pathologically heterogeneous cutaneous ADR with a female predominance. Delayed cutaneous ADR occurred as late as 30 days after vaccination. The majority of ADR were mild, though a few patients required systemic treatment (antihistamines, glucocorticosteroids). (4) Conclusions: The clinico-pathological spectrum of cutaneous side effects with COVID-19 vaccines is wide; however, the benefits outweigh the risks by far. More dermatopathological studies on cutaneous ADR not limited to COVID-19 vaccines are desirable to enable a better understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.},
