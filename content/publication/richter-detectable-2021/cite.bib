 abstract = {Background
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has challenged many of our current routine practices in the treatment and care of patients. Given the critical importance of blood donation and transfusion we analyzed 92 blood samples of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 stratified by symptoms.

Study Design and Methods
We therefore tested blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR targeting the E gene. In addition, we tested each blood sample for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies via ELISA and performed plaque reduction neutralization tests.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in the blood of mild to asymptomatic patients (57 individuals) and only detectable in individuals with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (35 individuals) (n = 6/92 [6.5%]; p = 0.023 Fisher's exact test). Interestingly, anti-spike IgG antibodies were not significantly higher in intensive care unit patients compared to mild patients, but we found that their neutralizing capacity was disproportionately increased (p \textless 0.001).

Conclusion
Our observations support the hypothesis that there are no potential hazards from blood or plasma transfusion of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals with mild flu-like symptoms and more importantly of asymptomatic individuals.},
