abstract: "textlessptextgreaterBackground. COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 may rarely lead to vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Antibody-mediated, platelet factor 4 (PF4) dependent platelet activation appears to resemble a key mechanism in VITT, partially comparable to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The use of PF4/heparin immunoassays has been proposed as part of a diagnostic approach, but their sensitivity has not been established. Methods. Sera from 12 well-defined VITT patients were first studied by two different laboratories in functional assays. Sera where then used for an inter-laboratory comparison, in which 5 different PF4/heparin immunoassays were used by 4 laboratories. Results. Results for functional testing were highly concordant. VITT antibodies were also reliably detected by PF4/heparin ELISAs (92-100%). In contrast, only 25% of VITT antibodies were reactive in a particle gel immunoassay (PaGIA), and 8% in a lateral flow assay (LFA). An automated chemiluminescence assay (CLIA) was negative for all sera tested (0%). Conclusion. It seems feasible to establish functional antibody testing for the confirmation of VITT. For the initial screening of suspected VITT cases, PaGIA, LFA, and CLIA are useless when applied as single tests. Only ELISA-based PF4/heparin immunoassays are sensitive enough to be incorporated in the diagnostic work-up. However, a combination of a positive ELISA and a negative CLIA may be useful to identify VITT antibodies in the absence of confirmatory functional assays. textless/ptextgreater"
