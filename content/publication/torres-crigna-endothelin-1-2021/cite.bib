 abstract = {Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is involved in the regulation of a myriad of processes highly relevant for physical and mental well-being; female and male health; in the modulation of senses, pain, stress reactions and drug sensitivity as well asÂ healing processes, amongst others. Shifted ET-1 homeostasis may influence and predict the development and progression of suboptimal health conditions, metabolic impairments with cascading complications, ageing and related pathologies, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative pathologies, aggressive malignancies, modulating, therefore, individual outcomes of both non-communicable and infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the involvement of ET-1 and related regulatory pathways in physiological and pathophysiological processes and estimates its capacity as
a predictor of ageing and related pathologies,a sensor of lifestyle quality and progression of suboptimal health conditions to diseases for their targeted preventionand as a potent target for cost-effective treatments tailored to the person.},
