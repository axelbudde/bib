abstract: "TThe emergence of more transmissible or aggressive variants of SARS-CoV-2 requires the development of antiviral medication that is quickly adjustable to evolving viral escape mutations. Here we report the synthesis of chemically stabilized small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SARS-CoV-2. The siRNA can be further modified with receptor ligands such as peptides using Cu(I)-catalysed click-chemistry. We demonstrate that optimized siRNAs can reduce viral loads and virus-induced cytotoxicity by up to five orders of magnitude in cell lines challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we show that an ACE2-binding peptide-conjugated siRNA is able to reduce virus replication and virus-induced apoptosis in 3D mucociliary lung microtissues. The adjustment of the siRNA sequence allows a rapid adaptation of their antiviral activity against different variants of concern. The ability to conjugate the siRNA via click-chemistry to receptor ligands facilitates the construction of targeted siRNAs for a flexible antiviral defence strategy."
