 abstract = {Background The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been impeding HIV diagnosis and treatment worldwide. Data on the impact of COVID-19 on late diagnosis (LD) in Germany are lacking. Here we present novel data of a single-centre German HIV cohort assessing LD during COVID-19. Methods This is a non-interventional, single-centre retrospective cohort assessing the rate of LD comparing HIV diagnoses pre-COVID-19 with those during the COVID-19 pandemic. New diagnoses between 1 January 2019 and 1 February 2020 were classified as pre-COVID-19, and diagnoses between 1 February 2020 and 1 October 2021 were classified as during COVID-19. Results Between 1 January 2019 and 1 October 2021, 75 patients presented with newly diagnosed HIV infection, 34 pre-COVID-19 and 41 during COVID-19. LD increased to 83% (n = 34/41) during COVID-19 versus 59% (n = 20/34) pre-COVID-19, and CDC stage C3 rose to 44% (n = 18) versus 27%. Hospitalization rate increased to 49% (n = 20) during COVID-19 versus 29% pre-COVID-19, and 12% (n = 5) presented with HIV-associated neurological disease, whereas none were observed in the pre-COVID-19 group. The incidence of LD (p = 0.020), CD4 count \textless 350 cells/μL (p = 0.037) and \textless 200 cells/μL (p = 0.022) were statistically significantly associated with the ongoing COVID-pandemic. An association with HIV transmission risk was borderline significant (p = 0.055). Conclusions Despite comparable annual rates of new HIV diagnoses, LD has been increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in more opportunistic infections and higher hospitalization rates, possibly reflecting pandemic-related shortages in HIV testing and care facilities. Maintaining HIV testing opportunities and access to treatment during a pandemic is crucial so as not to impede WHO elimination goals and so as to prevent an increase in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality.},
