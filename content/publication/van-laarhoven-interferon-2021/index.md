abstract: "In patients with impaired immune systems, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can persist for a long time. This contributes to a long disease course and poor outcome. Thus far, no therapy is available to help clear the virus. Interferon gamma is a protein that activates cells of the immune system. We applied interferon gamma to five COVID-19 patients with impaired immune systems. These patients were critically ill and did not clear the virus themselves. Interferon gamma therapy was followed by clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in five and clinical recovery in four patients. This report shows that interferon gamma should be considered as a study candidate for immunocompromised COVID-19 patients who are not able to clear the virus themselves., van Laarhoven et al. report five COVID-19 patients with impaired cellular immunity and persistently high SARS-CoV-2 loads, treated with last-resort interferon gamma immunotherapy, which was followed by viral clearance in five and clinical recovery in four patients. No signs of hyperinflammation were observed."
