 abstract = {, The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 presents a
global health
emergency. Therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2 are still very limited
but urgently required. Molecular tweezers are supramolecular agents
that destabilize the envelope of viruses resulting in a loss of viral
infectivity. Here, we show that first-generation tweezers, CLR01 and
CLR05, disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and abrogate viral infectivity.
To increase the antiviral activity, a series of 34 advanced molecular
tweezers were synthesized by insertion of aliphatic or aromatic ester
groups on the phosphate moieties of the parent molecule CLR01. A structure-activity
relationship study enabled the identification of tweezers with a markedly
enhanced ability to destroy lipid bilayers and to suppress SARS-CoV-2
infection. Selected tweezer derivatives retain activity in airway
mucus and inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 wildtype and variants of concern
as well as respiratory syncytial, influenza, and measles viruses.
Moreover, inhibitory activity of advanced tweezers against respiratory
syncytial virus and SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in mice. Thus, potentiated
tweezers are broad-spectrum antiviral agents with great prospects
for clinical development to combat highly pathogenic viruses.},
